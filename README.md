## 1. Baseline Replication

To ensure methodological rigor, I fully replicated the baseline stereotype classification pipeline from the HEARTS framework.

### 1.1 Repository Cloning

I successfully cloned and executed the official HEARTS repository:

git clone https://github.com/holistic-ai/HEARTS-Text-Stereotype-Detection

All scripts executed without modification after environment reconstruction.

## 2. Environment & Dependency Documentation

Requirements.txt and environment.yml are provided.
